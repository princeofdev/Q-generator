Setting Up QuickBooks
There are 5 steps to setting up and getting started using QuickBooks Online.
1. Create QuickBooks Account
This is how you create your company in QuickBooks.
2. Customize/Personalize QuickBooks
Customize your settings and invoices to make QuickBooks work best for you. Also,
invite other people to your company file and set up their permissions.
3. Import Lists or QuickBooks Desktop Data
If you are coming to QuickBooks Online from QuickBooks Pro or Premier, you can
import your company file to your QuickBooks Online account and your transactions,
lists, and opening balances will come over during that process. If you are coming to
QuickBooks Online from another accounting program that is not QuickBooks Pro or
Premier, you can import your lists (customers, vendors, chart of accounts, products
and services) using CSV or Excel files.
4. Enter Opening Balances
Entering account balances is necessary to get complete and accurate financial
statements. Opening balances become the “starting point” for your business because
they catch QuickBooks up to how much you had in a bank account, or owed on a
credit card, as of a specific date that you choose. Most businesses choose the
beginning of a fiscal year as the starting point for their QuickBooks data, so the
balance of an account on that date is used to set up its opening balance. You can
find that number on your bank and credit card statements.
5. Link Your Bank Account
This helps you add and categorize bank transactions going forward. It also makes
reconciliations significantly easier, which you’ll learn about later in the training.

Step 1: Create QuickBooks Account
Getting started with QuickBooks Online for your own business is easy. Just follow the
steps below to start a free trial.

Choose an Edition and Start a Free Trial
There are several editions of QuickBooks. Each edition includes basic features such
as check writing, entering sales, and additional features and capabilities to support
your growing business. To review features and compare current online editions, visit
https://quickbooks.intuit.com/online/compare/.
Note: The QuickBooks Online setup steps frequently change. The screenshots you
see in this part of our manual may not match exactly to what you see on the site.

Step 2: Customize/Personalize QuickBooks
During account creation you might be asked how you plan to use QuickBooks. Pages
like these help QuickBooks customize your account to best suit your company’s
needs. Anything you select/change can be customized later.

Accountant View vs. Business View
Based on your choice in the screen below, your QBO account will be in “Accountant
View” or “Business View.” These different views slightly alter the names of some
transactions, but QBO still operates in the same way, regardless of your choice. You
can also change this choice in your company’s Advanced settings later.

QuickBooks Online Setup - Day 1: Chapter 1

Review/Update Company Settings
After setup, you may want to customize your QuickBooks settings and forms to suit
your needs. You learn about personalizing QuickBooks throughout this class.
Click the Gear menu and select Account and Settings.
Make the appropriate selections in the Account and Settings page.
Click Done.

Step 3: Import Data
Import Company File from QuickBooks Pro/Premier
If you have your accounting information in a QuickBooks Pro or Premier company file,
you can copy the data to you QuickBooks Online account. The process takes a few
minutes, and most of your transactions, lists, and account balances are brought over.

Export Company File to QuickBooks Online
Within QuickBooks Desktop, click the Company menu and select Export Company
File to QuickBooks Online.
Follow the onscreen instructions.

Tips for a Successful Conversion
There are a few tasks you should complete in your desktop company file before you
convert it to QuickBooks Online.

Before you Convert to QuickBooks Online
•
•
•

Reconcile your Checking and Credit Card accounts
Pay Sales and Payroll Taxes
File Payroll quarterly forms (you’ll need to set up payroll again in QuickBooks
Online)

After you Convert
Open your QuickBooks desktop company and QuickBooks Online company at the
same time. Run the following reports in both and compare. The balances should
match.
• Profit and Loss Standard
• Balance Sheet Standard
• A/R Aging Summary
• A/P Aging Summary

Mastering QuickBooks Online Level 1

Import Lists from CSV or Excel Files
If you currently use QuickBooks Pro or Premier, your lists are imported during the
conversion to QuickBooks Online. However, if you use a different accounting
program, you can import lists with CSV or Excel files. Just export the lists you want to
bring into QuickBooks, such as your list of customers, and use the menu below to
bring them into QuickBooks.
Click the Gear menu and select Import Data.

Select the kind of data you want to import into QuickBooks.

Page 10

QuickBooks Online Setup - Day 1: Chapter 1

Step 4: Enter Opening Balances
If you currently use a desktop edition of QuickBooks, account opening balances will
be included during the conversion to QuickBooks Online. However, if you use
another accounting program, you will need to enter opening balances for most
accounts on your Balance Sheet. Opening balances serve as your “starting point” for
your accounts. They summarize how much money you had in a bank account, or
owed on a credit card/loan, as of a specific day. Typically businesses choose the first
day of their fiscal year as their starting point and use bank and credit card statements
to find out what their balances were on that day.
You have three choices when entering account opening balances:
1. Enter an opening balance as you set up the account.
When you set up a new account on your Chart of Accounts you can enter the opening
balance and the account’s starting point at the bottom right of the New Account
screen.
2. Let the Online Banking feature enter opening balances for you.
When you link a bank or credit card account to QBO, you’re asked how far back you
want it to go to download transactions. This is used to automatically set your starting
date for the account and also the opening balance.
3. Enter a journal entry for opening balances.
This usually requires help from an accountant. Don’t worry if you can’t do it right
away. You can start using QuickBooks now.

Enter Journal Entry for Opening Balances
1. Click the New (+) menu and select Journal Entry.

Mastering QuickBooks Online Level 1

Page 11

Step 5: Link Bank Accounts
When you link your checking and credit-card accounts with QuickBooks, you choose
how far back you want QuickBooks to look when it downloads transactions. It’s
generally recommended to start from the beginning of your fiscal year. You can also
tell QuickBooks what transactions to exclude if you download something you’ve
already recorded, or notice a duplicated transaction.

Link Bank Account
Click Banking on the navigation bar.
Click Connect account in the Bank accounts section of the page.
Follow the onscreen instructions.

Test Drive QuickBooks Online
You can practice in QuickBooks using a sample file. Please note: The test drive will
expire and log you out due to inactivity after about an hour and any changes or
transactions you’ve entered will be deleted.

Start Test Drive
Open an internet browser.
Browse to https://qbo.intuit.com/redir/testdrive. You can also do a Google
search for “QBO Test Drive” to find the test drive page.
Enter the provided security code or Captcha.

dashboard, and bank account balances. You can enable Private Mode to hide this
sensitive data if you’re using QuickBooks in a public place.

The Search/Recent Transactions menu is an easy way to search by transaction
number, date, amount, and name. You can quickly open a recently entered
transaction from the Recent Transactions list.

What You See on a Transaction

All the forms in QuickBooks look similar. This makes it even easier to get around and
enter transactions. Just fill out the “Who?” and the “When” at the top, the “What?”
below, and the amount or the “How Much.”

Parts of a QuickBooks Transaction

1.
2.
4.

3.

Who- Who are you paying or who is paying you?
When- When the transaction happened in the real world.
What- What are you purchasing or selling?
How Much – The amount of money you receive or spend on a transaction.

Page 18

Getting Around – Day 1: Chapter 2

Chapter 3

Lists

Page 19

What are Lists?
QuickBooks uses lists to organize information about the people and businesses you
buy things from as well as the things you buy and sell. Lists help you save time in
several ways:
1. They store information about people and businesses you work with so you can
record transactions more quickly.
2. They help you find transactions you previously entered and also run reports to
see how much money you’ve spent/received with a specific person or
business.
3. They also let you track who owes you money and who you owe money to.

List types
The user interface and functionality of lists is different depending on what type of list
you are working with. For example, with Names lists (Customers, Vendors and
Employees), you have a Center that helps you quickly sort and filter information. On
Other Lists (Chart of Accounts, Terms List, Products and Services List, etc.), your
choices for interaction are more limited but you can still add/remove columns and
resort the list.

Names Lists
Names lists include Customers, Vendors, and Employees. You work with names lists
often and you see them often throughout QuickBooks.

Page 20

Lists – Day 1: Chapter 3

Who Goes on Which Names List?
Customers - This list stores the people or businesses that pay you money for goods,
services and donations. To invoice a company on account or to track sales/donations
by customer, they must be entered as a customer.
Vendors (Suppliers) - This list stores the companies and contractors you pay for
goods or services. To track accounts payable (money you owe on open bills), issue a
1099, or track purchases by person or business, they must be set up as a vendor.
Employees - This list stores employees and their related payroll information. To pay
an employee using payroll or issue a W-2 to an employee, he/she must be entered as
an employee. Note that the Employees List is only for W-2 employees. People you
issue a 1099 to are considered vendors/contractors.

Other Lists
Other Lists include Products and Services, the Chart of Accounts, etc. You use these
lists often because they’re related to transactions, but you don’t need to update them
very often.

Chapter 4

Financial
Statements

Page 29

Financial Statements
For those of you who are from a non-accounting background, this chapter will help
you to learn some accounting basics, which leads to understanding more about how
QuickBooks works. You’ll discover the intention behind the Chart of Accounts and
how it relates to two financial statements: the Balance Sheet and the Profit & Loss.

Chart of Accounts
The Chart of Accounts represents the “hub” of your accounting system. Each account
represents something that your business owns/owes or a reason that your business
earns/spends money. As you record transactions, you assign accounts that represent
where the money came from/went to and why. After each transaction, account
balances are updated on your financial statements based on the accounts and
amounts you entered.
For example, you used a debit card in an office supplies store and then later
download the transaction. The first account affected by the transaction is the
Checking account linked to your debit card. That represents where the money came
from/went to. The second account the transaction affects is a summary of why money
was earned/spent…in this case, office supplies. So you would probably use an
expense account named Office Supplies so that you could track how much you’ve
spent on office supplies over time.

Page 30

Financial Statements - Day 1: Chapter 4

Balance Sheet
The Balance Sheet is the financial snapshot or position of your business. If someone
took a photograph of your business right now, it would the Balance Sheet? The
Balance Sheet is comprised of assets, liabilities, and equity.
Assets
Anything owned by your business. Assets include cash/liquid assets like bank
accounts, inventory you plan to sell to customers, fixed assets like vehicles and
equipment, and even receivables that are owed to you by customers.
Liabilities
What your business owes people/companies outside of your business. Liabilities
include credit cards, loans like mortgages and car notes, lines of credit and even
payables that you owe on open bills from vendors.
Equity
What the business owes the owners of the business. Equity is used to track
investments into the business, draws out of the business to pay the owner/partner
and retained earnings. You might also see an account called Opening Balance
Equity, which is a summary of what the business was worth to the owner before the
business started using QuickBooks.

This statement is the movie of your business. It measures performance over a
specified time period. This financial statement includes income, costs of goods sold
and expenses.
Income
Income accounts track money that comes into your business through the sale of
goods or services. They’re also used to track income generated through donations
or pledges from donors. Examples include sales and service income.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of Goods Sold accounts track the money you spend that is directly related to a
specific sale. This includes the cost of contractors you paid to work on a specific job,
materials that are purchased for a specific customer/project, and even the original
purchase price of inventory that you’ve sold. Note that if you use inventory products
& services, QuickBooks automatically calculates the cost of goods sold for you when
you record your sale of inventory. You learn about this in the Inventory chapter.
Expenses
Expense accounts track what your business spends on regular expenses like rent,
insurance and payroll. Expenses are also often called “overhead” and don’t tend to
increase or decrease based on the work you perform.

Journal Entries
Occasionally, you may need to change the balances of your accounts in the chart of
accounts. Typically account balances should be updated with regular transactions
and not journal entries. However, there are three occasions that might call for a
journal entry:
You need to record something that another transaction just can’t summarize, like
the depreciation of an asset.
You need to fix an error and your account gave you a journal entry to enter.
You’re setting up a new company and need to enter many balances at once.

Products and Services Settings
Products and Services are the things you charge customers for, whether that happens
to be physical goods, services performed, or even pledges and donations. Reviewing
your products and services settings can help customize QuickBooks to suit your
needs.

Turn Off Products and Services
It’s possible that your business doesn’t need products or services because your
company is small enough that there is no need to separate what you do into separate
categories. If this is the case, you can products and services off in order to remove
certain fields on your sales forms.
Click the Gear menu and select Account and Settings.
Click Sales on the list to the left.

Understanding Products and Services
Products and Services can make using QuickBooks easier and provide additional
information to help you run your business. They perform the following functions:
Make it easier to fill out forms by providing default descriptions and sale prices.
Act as pointers to the financial statements. In other words, they handle the behind
the scenes accounting for sales and purchases, routing the correct amounts to
your income and expense accounts.
Can help you track the quantity of products you’ve sold, or hours of services
you’ve charged customers for.

Money In- I

Page 47

Money In Part I
Without your customers you wouldn't have a company. QuickBooks helps you track
your customers’ information, their balances, and who has paid you. This chapter
guides you through setting up customer information, sending and tracking invoices,
and depositing their payments at the bank. You’ll learn about great reports that help
you with collections and help you track who’s overdue. When your customer pays,
QuickBooks helps you close your Invoice and record the deposit at your bank.

Customers
The Customers list stores information about your customers and makes it easy to find
out which customers owe you money, are overdue on payments, etc.

Sales Transactions
You can also see sales transactions in the Sales/Invoicing tab.

Customer Information

Set up a Sub-Customer
Many businesses have separate jobs with the same customer that they’d like to track
separately for job costing. QuickBooks Online helps you do this with sub-customers.
With sub-customers, you can see your income and expenses for each job, but still bill
the customer for the work that’s been done. This also helps track multiple addresses.
Create New Customer OR Edit an Existing Customer
Select the box next to Is sub-customer
Select the parent customer in the drop-down

Methods to Record Sales
There are 4 ways to record sales in QuickBooks.
Invoice - Use this method if a customer owes you money and will pay you later.
Sales Receipt - Use this method if your customer pays you at the time of the sale.
Deposit - Use this method to record income on a deposit, when none of the
previous methods are used.
Import from Other Program- Use this method if you use an integrated app to
capture sales.

Method 1- Invoice
Use this workflow if the customer pays you later. As you enter invoices, Accounts
Receivable increases, and the customer is given a due date to pay their balance.

Steps for Method 1
Create Invoice
Receive Payment
Make Deposit

Step 1. Enter Invoice
Click the New (+) button.
Select Invoice.
Click the customer drop-down arrow and select the appropriate customer.
Click the Product/Service drop-down arrow to add the appropriate products
and/or services.
Click the Save and send drop-down arrow and select the appropriate option.

Page 50

Money In- I – Day 1: Chapter 6

What is Accounts Receivable?
When you enter an invoice for a customer, QuickBooks tracks the open balance in the
Accounts Receivable account. The balance in this account is the total of all open
invoices you have for your customers. When you apply payment against an invoice,
the balance goes down.

Accounts Receivable Reports

What Is Undeposited Funds?
If you use Undeposited Funds, you can combine multiple customer payments into a
single deposit so that your records in QuickBooks match your bank’s records
exactly. This is the general workflow for sales where a customer is given time between
receiving a product or service and paying.
Rename Undeposited Funds (Optional)
QuickBooks uses an account called Undeposited Funds to hold money received that
is waiting to be deposited. Renaming this account can help you understand where
the money really is. For example, if you keep customer checks and cash payments in
a blue vinyl bank bag, you could rename your Undeposited Funds account to ‘Blue
Vinyl Bank Bag’. If you have multiple places where you keep customer payments
before they are deposited, you can use a generic term like ‘Payments to be
Deposited’.
Click Accounting on the left navigation bar and select Chart of Accounts.
Next to Undeposited Funds (Other Current Asset) click the drop-down arrow in
the Action column and select Edit.
Enter an appropriate account Name.

Method 2-Sales Receipts
Enter sales receipts when your customer pays you in full at the time of the sale. Sales
receipts record income and they also record where the money goes. Whenever
you're receiving money it can go into Undeposited Funds, just like with invoices and
receiving payments, or they can go directly into a bank account. The second step in
this process is a bank deposit.

Steps for Method 2

Step 1. Create Sales Receipt
Click the New (+) button.
Select Sales Receipt.

Sales Tax

Page 85

What is Sales Tax?
Sales taxes are taxes placed on the sale or lease of goods and services. Sales tax is
governed at the state level in the United States and there is no national sales tax.

Set Up Sales Tax
If you sell taxable goods or services, you’ll need to collect the sales tax for your state
and any other qualifying state. QuickBooks automatically chooses the sales tax rate
based on your location. But if you have a distribution center or an office in another
state, you’ll also need to collect sales tax on sales made in that state. Intuit has
thought of this and during the sales tax setup you can tell QuickBooks you’re
required to collect tax for other states.

Taxable Sale
To record a taxable sale, either use a product that you’ve set up as a taxable item, or
check the box beside “Tax” to make an item taxable from the sales form window.
QuickBooks then adds up all of the taxable products and displays them as a Taxable
subtotal. QuickBooks then adds up all of the taxable products and displays them here
as a Taxable subtotal. This is the amount of sales tax the customer will pay. You
collect this amount on the sale, and then later, send this money to the state.

Non-taxable Sale
In order for the sale to include sales tax, two things must be true: the product or
service being sold must be taxable and the customer must be taxable as well. As long
as one of those situations is not true to the sale being made, it will remain nontaxable.

Pay Sales Taxes
When you collect sales tax, you’re in a unique position. Since it’s money you have
that’s owed to someone else, it’s considered a liability on your Balance Sheet.
Whenever you collect sales tax, QuickBooks calculates the tax amount and increases
the account balance for you. When you send the money to the tax agency you
collected for, QuickBooks lowers the balance of the account.

Money Out- I

Mastering QuickBooks Online Level 1

Page 91

Vendors
Companies or individuals you purchase goods or services from are called vendors (or
Suppliers in QuickBooks Online Canada). If you need to enter a bill, send a 1099 to a
company or individual, or track purchases by vendor, they must be set up as a
vendor. The Vendors list stores vendor information and makes it easy to filter to see
all vendors, vendors you owe money to and even vendors that you’re overdue on
paying.

Purchase/Expense Transactions
You can also see purchase and expense transactions associated with vendors.

Money Out Workflow
Your bookkeeping should accurately mirror the transactions that occur in the real
world as closely as possible. There are two different ways to enter and pay bills. The
method you use depends on if you track accounts payable for a transaction.

Mastering QuickBooks Online Level 1

Page 93

Method 1: Use Accounts Payable
What is Accounts Payable?
Tracking accounts payable means that you enter the bill before paying the vendor. If
you track accounts payable, you always know how much you owe vendors for bills.
Expenses are also recorded in the correct accounting period. You will also be warned
when entering duplicate bills.
Not all money out transactions require you to use Accounts Payable. If you pay for
something right away, or you paid it in the past, you won’t need to use Accounts
Payable. You learn how to deal with those kinds of money out transactions later.

Steps if you use Accounts Payable
Enter Bill
Pay Bill (regardless of how you pay the bill: check, credit card, PayPal, cash, other

Page 94

1. Company Setting-Warn About Duplicate Bills
Click the Gear menu and select Account and Settings.
Click Advanced on the list to the left.
Click in the Other preferences section.
Click the box next to Warn if duplicate bill number is used.
Click Save.

2. Greater Control over Expenses and Financial Statements
Using Bills allows you to realize the expense on the day of the Bill and not the day of
the Bill Payment.

3. Keep Track of Who you Owe and Bill Due Dates
By using Bills you have access to two important Accounts Payable reports: Accounts
Payable Aging Summary and Detail. Both reports show who you owe, how much you
owe them and if you are overdue. The Summary report shows totals owed to the
vendor whereas the Detail report shows each bill separately.

Mastering QuickBooks Online Level 1

Step 1. Record Bills
Click the New (+) menu.
Select Bill.
Enter the appropriate information on the bill.
Click Save and close.

Should You Record a Bill Payment?
If you enter a Bill in QuickBooks the only way to record the payment is with Pay Bills.
Entering the Bill increases Accounts Payable and your payment lowers Accounts
Payable. It is, however, possible that you’ll also download your bill payments. If you
record a bill and then later download the bill payment, you won’t need to enter it
manually at all. Just visit the Banking Center and you should see the downloaded
transaction “Match” against your bill. If, however, you pay a bill with a check or aren’t
using online banking, you can still enter bill payments manually.

Method 2: No Accounts Payable
If you’ve decided to not track Accounts Payable in QuickBooks,
or you’ve just paid for something that didn’t involve a bill, you
don’t need to use Bills/Bill Payments. Instead, all you have to
record is a Check or Expense. Checks are used for physical
checks that are not connected with a bill. Whether you want to
print them through QuickBooks or record a handwritten check,
Checks are the right transaction to record. If you spent money
through any method other than a check use an Expense instead.
Record a Check
Click the Global Create menu.
Select Check.
Enter the appropriate information on the Check form.
Click Print check to print the check now. Otherwise, click the box next to Print

Online Banking – Day 2: Chapter 14

The Online Banking Center
After you’ve connected your bank account to QuickBooks, you’re ready to update
QuickBooks with new bank activity. You manage this process through the Online
Banking Center.
Note: Each connected account shows a Bank Balance and an In QuickBooks balance.
These balances will often differ from each other as the Bank Balance is based on
transactions that have cleared the bank account, and the QuickBooks Balance is
based only on transactions that have been recorded in QuickBooks.

Online Banking Center Processes
The Bank and Credit Cards page is where you perform all your online banking tasks.
• File upload
Click File upload to upload a list of transactions from your bank. Note that you
won’t need to do this if you choose to connect your bank to QuickBooks.
• Link account
Click Link account to connect a new account to QuickBooks.
• For Review
The For Review tab lists transactions downloaded from your bank that haven’t
been added or matched to existing transactions in QuickBooks. Until these
transactions are added or matched, they have no impact on your accounting
records.
• Categorized
The Categorized tab lists transactions you have matched or added to QuickBooks.
This tab does NOT show transactions that you manually entered into QuickBooks.
• Excluded
The Excluded tab lists transactions you have chosen to exclude, such as duplicate
transactions or transaction history you don’t need in QuickBooks. You can undo
this action at any time.

Open the Online Banking Center
Click Banking on the navigation bar.
Select an account from the top of the page.

Manage Downloaded Transactions
There are two types of downloaded transactions: ones that you have already entered
into QuickBooks, and ones that have not been entered into QuickBooks.
Match- Transactions that you’ve already entered need to be verified or ‘matched’ to
the downloaded expense. If QuickBooks finds that you’ve already entered something
that it has downloaded, you’ll see “Match” or “View” as an option. By matching a
downloaded transaction with something you’ve already entered, you ensure that the
transaction is not entered twice. QuickBooks attaches the downloaded version to the
version you’ve already entered.
View- If QuickBooks finds that you’ve already entered two or more transactions like
the bank transaction you’ve downloaded, you’ll need to choose the exact transaction
which is a match. The non-selected transaction(s) will remain in the Online Banking
center until action is taken on that remaining transaction.

Select the appropriate match, or click Find match if the transaction was not

Click Match.

Batch Accept Downloaded Transactions (Already Entered)
On the For Review tab, select all matched transactions.
Check the box to the left of the desired transactions and select Accept.

Mastering QuickBooks Online Level 1

Page 115

Add Downloaded Transactions (Not Already Entered)
New transactions that you haven’t recorded in QuickBooks yet can be “added,” which
means that QuickBooks creates a new transaction for you based on the downloaded
information and the information that you add into the transaction, specifically the
Who, When, What and How Much. Sort the list by the column headers to help
organize your work.
When dealing with a new transaction, you’ll see the date it cleared the bank (the
When), how much money it was for (the How Much), and something called the Bank
Detail, which is usually who you paid (the Who). QuickBooks cannot download the
reason Why you spent the money, so you must enter the category, or account, as an
explanation to QuickBooks for why the money was spent or received. In doing so,
you’ll be able to track why you spent or received the money later on your financial
statements.
On the For Review tab, select a transaction to add.
Correct or enter an appropriate name (optional) and account category.
Click Add.

Recognized Transactions
As you add information to downloaded transactions, QuickBooks ‘remembers’ the
accounts and names you’ve added to previous transactions, and prefills some of this
information for you. These transactions are listed together on the Recognized list. You
can batch add these recognized transactions to save time.

What Gets Downloaded
You might be wondering why you would need to manually add anything into
QuickBooks if your transactions are already downloaded from your connected bank
account. Since online banking makes it so easy to enter transactions, it’s tempting to
rely on it to record all of your transactions. However, there are some transactions that
cannot be downloaded from the bank that you still need to enter manually. If you
want QuickBooks to print a check, or if you want to record more specific products
and services a customer purchased from you, you’ll need to enter in those details
through a manually entered transaction.

Transactions You Add Through Online Banking
•

Receive Payment (should still be entered manually if it applies to multiple
invoices, or was deposited with other payments)

•

Expenses

•

Bill Payments (if a bill was paid with a check, it should still be entered manually)

•

Credit Card Credit

•

Transfers

Deposits

Page 118

Online Banking – Day 2: Chapter 14

Manage Downloaded Deposits
Deposits you make at the bank can be added through online banking if they’re
deposits for a single transaction. For example, a refund from a vendor. But if a
deposit you make at the bank is for a batch of transactions, such as customer
payments on invoices, you should still record it manually in QuickBooks.
When you receive a refund from a vendor, this effectively reduces the expense you
incurred with that vendor. When the refund is downloaded from the bank, select the
expense account you used on the original expense with the vendor to reduce your
expense account balance on your financial statement.

Review/Add Downloaded Deposits (Not Entered)
On the For Review tab, select the deposit.
(Optional) Add a vendor name.
In the Category field, select the appropriate income or expense account.
Click Add.

associated with it, you can do this with the Split option.

You can exclude downloaded transactions such as duplicates or transactions that
took place before when you chose to start tracking an account.

Reasons to Exclude Transactions
If you are connecting an account you have used manually in QuickBooks Online
and are now starting to download transactions from your bank and transactions
you’ve already reconciled appear in the Banking Center
If the bank sent the transaction more than once.
If the transaction happened before the starting date/balance for the account. In
other words, if it happened before the “As of” date that you entered for the
account as you set it up.

Exclude New Transactions
On the For Review tab, click the box next to transactions to exclude.
Click Exclude.

Transfers
Transfers are financial transactions that represent you moving money from one bank
account to another. They can be downloaded and added to QuickBooks without
entering them manually first. If you transfer money between two bank accounts that
you’ve connected to download transactions, then you only need to Add the transfer
for one account, and then Match it for the other.

Add Transfers
On the For Review tab, select the transfer.
In the Category field, select the account the money came from (if this is an
increase in the bank account) or the account the money went to (if this is a
decrease in the bank account).
Click Add.

Online Banking – Day 2: Chapter 14

Credit Card Payments
If you pay your credit card balance online or with your debit card, those payments will
be downloaded to the banking center.

Add Credit Card Payments
On the For Review tab, select the credit card payment.
(Optional) Click the Payee drop-down and select a payee.
In the Category field, select the credit card account to apply the payment towards.
Click Add.

Note: If you have your credit card account connected as well, once you Add the
transaction for the bank account, it will show up as a Match on the credit card
account.

Mastering QuickBooks Online Level 1

Page 123

Recording a Personal Expense
It’s tempting to want to exclude personal expenses, however, all transactions from
your bank account need to be recorded in QuickBooks in order for you to reconcile
the account. During reconciliations you compare your bank statements to what you
have in QuickBooks to make sure you’ve recorded everything that happened in that
account. If you exclude ANY transactions that appear on your bank statement, you’ll
not be able to reconcile.
Instead of excluding these transactions when they show up, you can use an Equity
account in the Category field to properly record the transaction. Most businesses
have an equity account named Owner’s Draw that is used for these kinds of personal
purchases. If you do not have this on your Chart of Accounts, you can easily create a
new Equity account with this name.

Reconciliation

Mastering QuickBooks Online Level 1

Page 125

Reconcile Bank Account
Trusting your reports and balances in QuickBooks is important. Your task with all
bookkeeping is to record transactions accurately so that they match with the reality of
your business’ bank and credit card accounts. The best way to check for accuracy is
to perform a reconciliation, which is the process of comparing your records in
QuickBooks to the official records you receive from your bank and credit card issuers.
When to reconcile: Real World Training recommends that you reconcile every month
when you receive the bank/credit card’s official statement.
Before you reconcile: To reconcile, you should have last month’s bank statement on
hand for this process, printed if possible.

Reconcile Account
Click the Gear menu and select Reconcile.
Click the Account drop-down arrow and select the appropriate bank or credit card
account.

Enter the Ending balance and the Ending date you see on the statement.
Click the Start reconciling button.
Select the transactions that cleared the bank.

What you’ll see on the reconciliations screen...
Reconciliation equation - Throughout the reconciliation process QBO calculates
several numbers. The first is the beginning balance which is the amount you had
in the bank at the beginning of the month. QuickBooks determines this by adding
up all of the transactions you’ve reconciled in the past. The Cleared Balance is the
balance of all the selected transactions. If what’s on the bank statement doesn’t
match what you’ve checked off for your cleared balance, QuickBooks shows you a
difference. That means there’s a difference between what you have in QuickBooks
and what the bank or credit card reports on the statement.
Pre-reconciled transactions - If you use Online Banking, the transactions you’ve
added or matched already have checkmarks. This is one of the great things that
online banking does for you. If you’re using online banking to add and match all
of your transactions you might just see an entire row of checkmarks and you won’t
need to do any more work at all since everything has already been checked
against the bank’s records.
The goal of the reconciliation - The goal is to check off all the transactions that
appear on your bank statement and get a difference of zero!

What Causes a Reconciliation Difference?
There are a few reasons for a difference between your bank or credit card statement
and what you have in QuickBooks.
The ending balance or date is incorrect. This can be fixed by clicking the Edit
button to change it to what you see on your statement.
You might have a transaction checked on the Reconciliation window that shouldn’t
be. To fix this, just uncheck it in the reconciliation window to remove it from the
balance.
One of the transactions you’ve checked in the reconciliations window is for the
wrong amount. You may edit the balance by clicking on the line of the incorrect
transaction.

It’s important to remember that in most cases you should never change transactions
after they’re reconciled. To track down changes or deletions if they happen, you can

including beginning and ending balances, as well as changes, if any have occurred,
and any adjustments that might have been made while reconciling.

Account Register
Every Balance Sheet account in QuickBooks has a register. A register is a record of all
the transactions you’ve recorded for that account. It shows transactions you manually
added, as well as those you matched and added through the Bank and Credit Cards
page. QuickBooks marks matched/added transactions as “C” cleared and indicates it
was an automatically added transaction. Reconciled transactions are indicated with an
“R”.

Reports

Working with Reports
The reason you use QuickBooks is to get reports. If entering transactions and
performing reconciliations is the work, then reports are the results. Reports you get
out of QuickBooks are only as reliable as the data that you put in, This chapter
teaches you how to find what you’re looking for in the QuickBooks reports center.

Run Reports
The Report Center is where you can find all the reports that help you keep track of
your business. There are four areas of the report list:
• All Reports
A list of all available reports in QuickBooks.
• Custom Reports
Reports that you have customized and memorized for future use.
• Management Reports
Customizable report packet that includes a cover letter, and table of contents.
• Search Box
Just type the name of a report and QuickBooks finds it for you.

Running Reports
Click Reports on the navigation bar.
Click Run next to the appropriate report or search for a report and press Enter.

Working With Reports- Day 2: Chapter 17

Types of Reports
There are three types of reports in QuickBooks. Each type offers different views of
company information and has varying levels of details.

List Reports
List reports are the most basic kind of report in QuickBooks. They don’t do any
analysis, they only list data. Examples include the Customer Contact List, and the
Invoice List. Lists reports are great if you want to look up a lot of data quickly. They
are good for looking up information and printing or exporting it.

Page 147

Detail Reports
Detail reports show the transactions that affect balances for customers, vendors,
accounts, or products and services. Examples include the Sales by Customer Detail
report, and Profit and Loss Detail

Page 148

Working With Reports- Day 2: Chapter 17

Summary Reports
Summary reports are the most used of the report types. They show a list of customers,
vendors, products and services, or accounts and information on balances associated
with them without showing the transactions that contribute to that balance. Examples
include the Sales by Customer Summary report, and the Balance Sheet.
Summary reports show you a total but instead of showing you each individual
transaction you’ll see a total for each item, whatever it might be. By clicking on the
total for a particular item, you’ll get a detail report that shows you individual
transactions that make up the total.

time.

how to create a closing date for your books post-reconciliation or year-end, as well as
how to add and manage users that you can add to your QuickBooks online account.

What is a Closing Date?
The Closing Date in QuickBooks essentially “locks” all of your transactions with a
specific date or any date before that chosen date. That makes it harder to change the
protected transactions. It also restricts the entry of new transactions with that date or
any date before it. To make any changes to the accounting period, a user must know
the closing date password (if you have set one).

Set Closing Date and Password
Click the Gear menu and select Account and Settings.
Click Advanced on the list to the left.
Click in the Accounting section.
Click the box next to Close the books.
Enter the Closing date.
Click the drop-down arrow and select the appropriate option.
(Optional) Enter the password in the Password and Confirm Password fields.

Before completing your payroll setup for each employee, QuickBooks will ask you to
provide details about any prior payroll payments that have been made for this
employee during the year. This step is crucial, because without the data in these
fields, you will not be able to create a proper W2 next year that includes all of the
employees pay for the year.
It’s also important that you enter this information now during the payroll setup steps,
because there is no way to backtrack and get back to this screen. This information has
to be entered now, or you will not be able to enter it without contacting QuickBooks

sets these accounts up based on the deductions and contributions created in the
setup process. Balances for these accounts are increased anytime the company
contributes toward the benefit or anytime money is withheld from an employees’
paycheck during the payroll process. To make the payment to the provider, you’re
going to use either an expense, a check or a bill.

Inventory

Page 193

Track Inventory
If you want to track the quantity on hand for a specific product in QuickBooks, you
should set it up as an inventory item. For example, a building supply company buys
doors and doorknobs, and sells them. Those products would be tracked as inventory.
Inventory tracking is not for tracking products that you manufacture. For example, a
bakery that buys flour and sugar, and produces cakes and cookies would not track
inventory for those products.

Enable Inventory
Click the Gear menu and select Account and Settings.
Click Sales on the list to the left.
