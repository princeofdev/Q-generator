Once upon a time, in a tropical jungle, there was a little monkey named Bongo. Bongo loved to eat bananas, and he ate them every day. One day, Bongo found a banana tree with the biggest bananas he had ever seen. He was so excited that he climbed up the tree to get one. But as he was about to grab a banana, he heard a strange noise. Suddenly, a group of monkeys appeared and chased him away. Bongo was sad and hungry, so he decided to ask his friend, the wise old owl, for advice. The owl told him that he needed to find a way to share the bananas with the other monkeys. Bongo came up with an idea and invited all the monkeys to a banana feast. At first, the other monkeys were hesitant, but when they saw how delicious the bananas were, they all joined in. From that day on, Bongo and the other monkeys shared the bananas from the big banana tree. They lived happily ever after, eating bananas every day. The end.
